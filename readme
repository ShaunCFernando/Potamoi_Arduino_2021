Potamoi is an innovative water quality monitoring device that I engineered from the ground up using Arduino. In addition, I developed a companion mobile application, myH2O, to log data in real time and store it on Airtable, enabling cloud-based access and visualization through a user-friendly interface.

This project utilizes more than 100 Arduino library components, which were not included in the repository since they are freely available as part of the standard software package. I also integrated additional third-party libraries locally to enhance the device’s capabilities and performance.

In 2024–2026, the device is scheduled for industrialization and disctribute across the nation and world.
